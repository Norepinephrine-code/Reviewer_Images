# Reviewer_Images
This is the collection of all images used for the online exams.

After you upload an image:

1. Click the image.
2. Drag it to a new tab at the top of your browser.
3. The image will open by itself — the web address you see in the address bar is the direct link (the raw PNG/JPG URL).
